## What Aniraku is

Aniraku keeps discovery, playback, watch history, ratings, bookmarks, comments, and recommendations close to the title you are watching. The goal is simple: spend less time moving between pages and more time watching.

The main flow is:

`discover` → `watch` → `remember`

The catalog uses AniList metadata, schedules, recommendations, and search. The player supports adaptive playback, provider fallback, subtitles, dubs, quality selection, seeking, and intro/outro skipping where the data is available. Progress and personal context remain attached to the title instead of disappearing after playback.

Contributions are welcome when they make the experience faster, clearer, more accessible, or more reliable. Read [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) before changing player, authentication, sync, or upstream integrations.
